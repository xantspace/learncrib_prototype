## ⚖️ Core Business Decisions

Based on the [Backend logic Specification](file:///c:/dev/learncrib/docs/backend_flow.md), the following rules apply:

- **Commission:** 15% platform fee on all sessions.
- **Payouts:** Weekly tutor payouts processed every **Friday at 10:00 AM**.
- **Escrow:** Funds held until 48 hours post-session (Confirmation Window).
- **Cancellations:**
    - > 24h: Full refund to parent.
    - < 24h: 50% refund to parent, 50% to tutor (minus fees).
- **Disputes:** Manual admin resolution required for any flagged sessions.

## 🚀 Collaboration Workflow

To ensure a smooth workflow:

1. **Directories**:
   - `/frontend`: All UI work goes here.
   - `/backend`: All Django/API logic goes here.
2. **API Contract**: We use `/docs/backend_flow.md` and `/docs/database_schema.sql` as our unified source of truth.
3. **Branches**: Work on individual feature branches (e.g., `feature/tutor-auth`) and merge to `main`.
